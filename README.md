# CodeCollab
A code snippet sharing platform, makes it easier to share, find, and review code snippets. 

CodeCollab is a web-based application that allows developers to share code snippets with the community and receive AI-powered code reviews. The platform aims to create an environment where programmers can learn from each other, improve their coding skills, and collaborate on various coding projects.

## Current Development

- I am finalizing the base HTML, CSS, and JS files to start building upon the
- I am gathering data for the AI model

## Features

- **Code Snippet Sharing**: Users can upload and share their code snippets with the community. They can categorize snippets based on programming languages, frameworks, or specific topics.

- **AI Code Review**: The platform uses advanced AI algorithms to analyze and review code snippets submitted by users. The AI provides feedback on code quality, best practices, potential bugs, and optimization suggestions.

- **User Profiles**: Developers can create profiles and view their shared snippets, AI code reviews, and overall platform engagement. User profiles foster a sense of community and recognition for active participants.

- **Commenting and Discussion**: Users can leave comments on shared code snippets, engage in discussions, and provide feedback to each other. This promotes collaboration and learning among developers.

- **Snippet Search and Discovery**: The platform offers a search functionality to find specific code snippets or browse through popular and trending code samples.

- **Code Challenges**: Occasionally, the platform may host coding challenges or contests to encourage developers to showcase their skills and compete with others.

- **Notifications**: Users receive notifications about AI code review results, comments on their snippets, and important platform updates.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: The platform's frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For a more dynamic and interactive user experience, a modern front-end framework like React or Vue.js is employed.

- **Backend**: The backend is developed using Node.js with Express.js as the server framework. It integrates with a database to store user information, snippets, comments, and AI code review results.

- **AI Code Review**: The AI code review functionality leverages machine learning models and static code analysis tools to analyze and provide feedback on the code snippets. Python and other AI libraries are used for this purpose.

- **Database**: The platform uses a relational or NoSQL database to store user data, code snippets, comments, and other relevant information.

- **Authentication**: User authentication and security measures are implemented using OAuth or JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

- **Deployment**: The platform is deployed using cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure for scalability and reliability.
